Optimization problems involve finding the best solution out of all possible solutions. These types of problems require all elements of the set of possible solutions to be examined in order to find the optimum. As the number of variables included for optimization increases, the amount of elements in the possible solution space increases drastically. 

Imagine you are leaving home and on your way to work, but you want to stop for coffee. There is only one possible path for you to take: from home, to the coffee shop, and then to work. But perhaps you also need to send a letter at the post office. Now you have two options for your trip: the post office first and then the coffee shop or the coffee shop first and then the post office before going to work. 

Now let’s add a third stop at the bank. Now the options for paths from home to work include:

coffee shop, post office, bank
coffee shop, bank, post office
bank, coffee shop, post office
bank, post office, coffee shop
post office, bank, coffee shop
post office, coffee shop, bank    
The problem of deciding what path to take from home to work is an example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, and the number of possible solutions grows as a factorial, n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)...*1, where n is the number of stops that must be taken. As the value of n increases, the total number of possible solutions calculated by n! increases rapidly. 

Returning to the example of the trip from home to work, we can see how the number of paths increases as a function of the included stops:

3 stops: 3! = 6 paths
4 stops: 4! = 24 paths 
5 stops: 5! = 120 paths
6 stops: 6! = 720 paths
7 stops: 7! = 5,040 paths
By the time we reach 7 stops, there are more than FIVE THOUSAND options to consider. Which is best? How would you know? 

The decision of what makes one path the ‘best’ as compared to the rest is often made with respect to reducing a cost such as number of required resources for the trip or total time taken for the journey. For example, in their routing problem, UPS optimizes routes for minimal left turns rather than shortest route.
