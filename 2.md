Quantum mechanics emerged in the 1920s to describe certain puzzling behaviors of elementary constituents of matter and light. It revolutionized physics and chemistry and led to inventions like the transistor, lasers, and GPS. In time, we came to understand that information itself can be acquired, encoded, and manipulated in quantum systems, giving birth to the new field of quantum information science (QIS). QIS studies how information science relates to quantum mechanical effects, and the field is highly multidisciplinary. In QIS, the work of physicists, computer scientists, mathematicians, materials scientists, chemists, and engineers comes together to tackle challenges in areas such as cryptography, logistics, optimization, and across the natural sciences. Notably, QIS can be applied to solve computing problems previously assumed to be out of reach without massive amounts of resources or compute time.

QIS in the form of quantum computing is projected to become a revolutionary computational model. A quantum computer encodes information and operates on information in a fundamentally different manner than implemented in a classical computer such as a laptop or supercomputer. These differences in the computational model may allow a quantum computer to solve some types of problems at a much faster rate than ever demonstrated before. In this course, the principles of quantum computing will be introduced in an intuitive manner. Supporting mathematics needed to understand quantum operations will be introduced on an as-needed basis. The only prerequisites are a basic understanding of algebra as well as the desire to learn more about an emerging and disruptive technology. 

This course will proceed as follows. First, we introduce you to quantum applications and what the hardware looks like. Then, we will gradually build your knowledge of quantum computing. In general, we’ll start with an intuitive introduction to a quantum mechanics phenomenon, followed by quantum operations that exploit that phenomenon. Next, we will introduce the quantum notation that we use to communicate those concepts. Finally, we’ll go through the mathematical calculations related to that concept. By the end of this course, you will have enough understanding to examine a well-known quantum algorithm, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. 

After finishing this course, you will be able to answer the following questions:

How are quantum computers and classical computers different?
How does quantum computing leverage phenomena from quantum mechanics? How does this give quantum computers an advantage? 
What is a quantum operation and circuit?
What is entanglement?
What kind of problems will quantum computer algorithms solve that are challenging for classical computers?
