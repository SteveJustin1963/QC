Introduction to Quantum Computing for Everyone

UChicagoX QUAN12000
Goals
Welcome! In this course, we delve into the interdisciplinary endeavor of quantum computing, with a focus on developing intuition about the major benefits and limits that are imposed on quantum computing by the quantum phenomena as well as getting comfortable with how basic quantum operations behave. The specific goals of the course are:

Learn the intuition behind the quantum mechanics principles that affect quantum computing.
Learn basic quantum computing operations
Learn the mathematics necessary to calculate quantum operations
Learn how individual quantum operations are combined to create higher-level operations and algorithms
As a virtual course, most of the content will be included as videos followed by individual questions to practice / check understanding. In each section, there will be a larger homework assignment that tests the understanding of all videos of the section.

Course Pacing and Access to Assignments
This is a self-paced course. Please note that access to graded problems is only available to those enrolled for the verified certificate.

Grading / Assignments
For those enrolled in the Verified track, each student’s final grade will be computed according to the following:

Practice questions following videos: 20%
Homework problems for each section: 35% 
Exam: 45%
Your lowest 2 scores on the practice questions will be dropped. 

An overall grade of 70% or higher will be considered a passing grade.

The Power of Quantum Computing and Quantum Operations
 
 

Section Overview
Quantum information science (QIS) is useful for a small set of very compelling applications, some of which we will introduce in this section. Then we’ll introduce some current quantum computing hardware and take a historical perspective on the development of quantum computing. Quantum operations occur at a qubit level. Unlike classical computing, there are not yet programming languages that allow programmers to abstract away critical details of quantum operations without needing to understand them. In this section, we will introduce operations on a single qubit.
